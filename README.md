# Peterside Hospital Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a patient having heart disease based on various medical indicators. The goal is to assist Peterside Hospital in improving the accuracy and speed of heart disease diagnosis.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

1. Data Exploration
   - Importing necessary libraries.
   - Loading the patient dataset.
   - Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships between medical indicators.

2. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
   - Cleaning the data and handling missing values.
   - Creating new features and selecting the most relevant ones for model training.

3. Model Development
   - Training various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and others.
   - Validating the models using the patient data.

4. Model Evaluation
   - Evaluating the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Selecting the best model with a focus on minimizing false negatives.

5. Implementation
   - Preparing the final model for implementation at Peterside Hospital.
   - Providing recommendations for future improvements and continuous monitoring.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to follow the analysis and model building steps.
4. Evaluate the model using the test data.
